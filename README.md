**web developer course part 2** covers advanced CSS, including pseudo-classes, pseudo-elements, and SASS for streamlined styling. I did also learn Flexbox for layout control and dive into JavaScript basics. The course concludes with creating a fully responsive website using Bootstrap and third-party libraries, expanding your web development skills.
